# Inference-Engine
An inference engine made in C# for propositional logic using the folling algorithms:
* Truth Table (TT) checking
* Backward Chaining (BC)
* Forward Chaining (FC) algorithms

# implementation
The following algorithms were written using the following pseudocode below

## Truth Table Checking

## Forward Chaining

## Backward Chaining
